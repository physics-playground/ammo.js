\chapter{Introduction to Bullet}
%\section{blablaIntroduction}
Bullet Physics is a professional open source collision detection, rigid body and soft body dynamics library. The library is free for commercial use under the \index{zlib license} \href{http://opensource.org/licenses/zlib-license.php}{zlib license}.

\section{Main Features}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Open source C++ code under zlib license and free for any commercial use on all platforms including PLAYSTATION 3, XBox 360, Wii, PC, Linux, Mac OSX, Android and iPhone
	\item Discrete and continuous collision detection including ray and convex sweep test. Collision shapes include concave and convex meshes and all basic primitives
	\item Fast and stable rigid body dynamics constraint solver, vehicle dynamics, character controller and slider, hinge, generic 6DOF and cone twist constraint for ragdolls
	\item Soft Body dynamics for cloth, rope and deformable volumes with two-way interaction with rigid bodies, including constraint support
	\item Maya Dynamica plugin, Blender integration, COLLADA physics import/export support
\end{itemize}

\section{Contact and Support}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Public forum for support and feedback is available at \url{http://bulletphysics.org}
\end{itemize}

\section{What's new}

\subsection{Preparing for Bullet 3.0 alpha}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The new Bullet 3.x version is making good progress, and the performance on high-end GPUs such as AMD 7970 and NVIDIA 680 is good. See the github repository at \url{https://github.com/erwincoumans/bullet3}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{New in Bullet 2.82}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Featherstone articulated body algorithm implementation with integration in the Bullet constraint solver. See See \path{demos/FeatherstoneMultiBodyDemo}
	\item New MLCP constraint solver interface for higher quality direct solvers. Dantzig (OpenDE), PATH and Projected Gauss Seidel MLCP solvers, with fallback to the original Bullet sequential impulse solver. See \path{src/BulletDynamics/MLCPSolvers}
	\item New btFixedConstraint as alternative to a btGeneric6DofConstraint with all DOFs locked. See \path{demos/VoronoiFractureDemo}
	\item Various bug fixes, related to force feedback and friction. Improved performance between btCompoundShape using the new btCompoundCompoundCollisionAlgorithm. See the commit log at \url{https://code.google.com/p/bullet/source/list}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{New in Bullet 2.81}
\begin{itemize}
	\item SIMD and Neon optimizations for iOS and Mac OSX, thanks to a contribution from Apple
	\item Rolling Friction using a constraint, thanks to Erin Catto for the idea. See \path{demos/RollingFrictionDemo/RollingFrictionDemo.cpp}
	\item XML serialization. See \path{Bullet/demos/BulletXmlImportDemo} and \path{Bullet/demos/SerializeDemo}
	\item Gear constraint. See \path{Bullet/demos/ConstraintDemo}.
	\item Improved continuous collision response, feeding speculative contacts to the constraint solver. See \path{Bullet/demos/CcdPhysicsDemo}
	\item Improved premake4 build system including support for Mac OSX, Linux and iOS
	\item Refactoring of collision detection pipeline using stack allocation instead of modifying the collision object. This will allow better future multithreading optimizations.
\end{itemize}
